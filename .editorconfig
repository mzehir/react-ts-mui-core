# EditorConfig is awesome: https://EditorConfig.org

root = true # This line indicates that this is the root .editorconfig file. If this is set to true, EditorConfig will stop searching for other .editorconfig files in parent directories. This ensures that this file serves as the top-level configuration for the project.

[*] # This line targets all file types. The [*] pattern means that the rules defined in this file will apply to all file extensions. If you want to specify rules for certain file types, you can use patterns like *.js or *.css.

insert_final_newline = true # This rule ensures that every file ends with a newline character. It automatically adds a new line at the end of each file. This is recommended by many coding standards because some tools and version control systems track changes more effectively when files end with a newline.

trim_trailing_whitespace = true # This rule removes any unnecessary whitespace at the end of each line. It improves code readability and prevents unwanted differences (diffs) in version control systems caused by trailing spaces.

indent_style = space # This rule enforces the use of spaces for indentation. Although tabs can also be used, spaces are generally more consistent and widely adopted across different editors and projects.

indent_size = 2 # This rule specifies the number of spaces to be used per indentation level. In this case, each indentation level will consist of 2 spaces, improving code readability and consistency.

end_of_line = lf # This rule sets the line ending style to Unix-style LF (Line Feed). Alternatively, CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed, used on Windows) or CR (Carriage Return, used in older Mac systems) can be used. LF is preferred in most Unix-based systems and version control systems like Git to ensure consistency.
